# Mineral Classification - Model
## üìù Description
This folder contains the pre-trained machine learning models and scripts used for classifying mineral images. The aim is to automatically categorize images into their respective mineral classes, enhancing our understanding and identification of various minerals.

## üìÇ Contents
**Mineral_Classification_Model_Training.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the complete process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
**README.md:** This document.
**mineral_classification_model.pkl:** Pre-trained Logistic Regression model used for mineral classification.
## üéØ Goal
The goal of this mineral classification project is to accurately identify mineral types from images using various machine learning models. By automatically classifying these images, the project aims to aid researchers and enthusiasts in mineral identification and analysis.

## üßÆ What I Did
In this mineral classification project, various models were evaluated to find the most effective one for classifying mineral images. The models evaluated include:

## Models Used
**Random Forest**
A robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane for separating different classes in the feature space.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a sample based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
A deep learning model particularly effective for image classification tasks due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies.

**Logistic Regression**
A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model binary dependent variables, extended here for multi-class classification.

**Decision Tree**
A model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure for classification.

**Extra Trees**
An ensemble learning method similar to Random Forest, but with more randomness injected into the tree construction process.
## Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

**Image Resizing and Normalization:** Images were resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized to ensure consistency.

**Feature Engineering:** Flattened images and applied standard scaling.

**Data Splitting:** Divided data into training, validation, and test sets for robust model evaluation.
## üöÄ Models Implemented
**Random Forest**
Performance: Achieved 100% accuracy due to the small dataset size.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
Performance: Achieved 100% accuracy.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
Performance: Achieved 100% accuracy.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
Performance: Achieved 100% accuracy.

**Logistic Regression**
Performance: Achieved 100% accuracy.

**Decision Tree**
Performance: Achieved 100% accuracy.

**Extra Trees**
Performance: Achieved 100% accuracy.
## üìà Performance of the Models
All models achieved 100% accuracy, indicating that the dataset is relatively small and potentially not very complex, allowing all models to perfectly classify the images.

## üì¢ Conclusion
The mineral classification project demonstrates that various machine learning models can accurately classify mineral images with high accuracy. The models help in automating the process of mineral identification, providing valuable assistance to researchers and enthusiasts.
